	// *COLOR*
	// You will notice below that we call a new function called glColor3ub()
	// This stands for (OpenGL Color with 3 parameters using unsigned bytes)
	// That means that, just like in GDI, we pass in the R G and B values from 0 to 255.
	// As you can see, we color the first point RED, then the next GREEN, then BLUE.
	// Coloring each vertex like this makes a cool blend effect.  This is called interpolation.
	// If we want to color from 0.0 to 1.0 we can use glColor3f() (IE.  glColor3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f); = RED)
	// Try commenting out the GREEN and BLUE lines.  What do you think will happen?
	// You got it!  It will turn the triangle RED.  That is how you use color.  Pretty simple huh?

	// Below we say that we want to draw triangles
	glBegin (GL_TRIANGLES);								// This is our BEGIN to draw

		glColor3ub(255, 0, 0);							// Make the top vertex RED
		glVertex3f(0, 1, 0);							// Here is the top point of the triangle

		glColor3ub(0, 255, 0);							// Make the left vertex GREEN
		glVertex3f(-1, 0, 0);							// Here is the left point of the triangle

		glColor3ub(0, 0, 255);							// Make the right vertex BLUE

// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// The functions that are in this source file are the ones that we will
// be changing on a regular basis.  The functions left in init.cpp are ones
// we will rarely touch, and when we do, it is maybe a line or so.  From now
// on, the tutorials that follow will use this project format.  It will allow
// us to simply focus on the main.cpp with less code, rather than sifting through
// tons of superfluous initialization code.
//
// So, what do you think?  Color is pretty simple huh?  The 2 functions that you
// will want to use is:  glColor3ub() and glColor3f().
//
// You usually want to use glColor3ub() because it works just like GDI so it might
// be a little more comfortable with you.  On the other hand, if you want more
// precision you will want to use glColor3f().  This makes it so you can use high
// precision floating point numbers like 0.33333f.  This comes in handy for heightmap
// terrain.  Also, you might want to use this because it could be more intuitive to
// think of the color from 0 to 1 because it's like 0 to 100 percent.  The only problem
// with using this is that floating point calculations are always more computationally
// expensive and you want to avoid them when ever you can.
//
// For example, we could actually use glVertex3i() instead of glVertex3f() since we aren't
// using floating point values for our triangle points, but it's rare that we use just
// whole numbers so I recommend just sticking with glVertex3f() unless you ONLY use
// integer numbers, which is rare, but faster.  If you are loading a model or dealing with
// cameras, you are always dealing with floating point values.  
//
// In the next tutorials we will actually show you how to move around in this world.
// That is when it starts to get REALLY cooOoOoOoOoOool.  
//
// For now, just start messing around with plotting points and changing colors.
