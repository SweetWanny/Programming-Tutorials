	// If we are given 2 vectors (the view and up vector) then we have a plane define.  
	// The cross product finds a vector that is perpendicular to that plane, 
	// which means it's point straight out of the plane at a 90 degree angle.
	// The equation for the cross product is simple, but difficult at first to memorize:
	
	// The X value for the vector is:  (V1.y * V2.z) - (V1.z * V2.y)													// Get the X value
	vNormal.x = ((vVector1.y * vVector2.z) - (vVector1.z * vVector2.y));
														
	// The Y value for the vector is:  (V1.z * V2.x) - (V1.x * V2.z)
	vNormal.y = ((vVector1.z * vVector2.x) - (vVector1.x * vVector2.z));
														
	// The Z value for the vector is:  (V1.x * V2.y) - (V1.y * V2.x)
	vNormal.z = ((vVector1.x * vVector2.y) - (vVector1.y * vVector2.x));

	// *IMPORTANT* This is not communitive. You can not change the order or this or
	// else it won't work correctly.  It has to be exactly like that.  Just remember,
	// If you are trying to find the X, you don't use the X value of the 2 vectors, and
	// it's the same for the Y and Z.  You notice you use the other 2, but never that axis.
	// If you look at the camera rotation tutorial, you will notice it's the same for rotations.

	// So why do I need the cross product to do a first person view?  Well, we need
	// to find the axis that our view has to rotate around.  Rotating the camera left
	// and right is simple, the axis is always (0, 1, 0).  Rotating around the camera
	// up and down is different because we are constantly going in and out of axises.
	// We need to find the axis that our camera is on, and that is why we use the cross
	// product.  By taking the cross product between our view vector and up vector,
	// we get a perpendicular vector to those 2 vectors, which is our desired axis.
	// Pick up a linear algebra book if you don't already have one, you'll need it.

	// Return the cross product

//
// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// Now we have the ability to look around our world with the mouse!  It's a great
// addition to our camera class isn't it?  Not much code either.  
// 
// Let me further explain what makes this work.  What we are doing is continuously
// putting the cursor in the middle of the screen every time we move the mouse, but
// before we do this, we get the new position that it moved.  Now that we have the
// position it moved from the center, we can do some simple math to find out which
// way we need to move/rotate the camera.  Lets do an example:
// 
// Lets say we changed our SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT to 640 480.  
// That would make our middle point at (320, 240).  THe '*' is the cursor position.
// We will call it P1 (Point 1)
//
//	 -----------------------------------
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |				 * P1 (320, 240)	|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//	 -----------------------------------
// 
//	Now, when we move the mouse, we store that position of where we moved.
//  Let's say we moved the mouse diagonally up and left a little bit.  Our new
//  point would be, let's say  P2 (319, 239)
//
//	 -----------------------------------
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |			   * P2 (319, 239)		|	(Figure is not pixel perfect :) )
//  |				\					|
//  |				 * (320, 240)		|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//  |									|
//	 -----------------------------------
//
//  Well, logic tells us that we need to rotate the camera to the left a bit,
//  and move the camera up a bit as well right???  Of course right.
// 
//  Well, the math is simple to find that out.  We just subtract P1 - P2.
//  That will give us a new x and y.  That is called the vector.
// 
//  What will the vector of those 2 points be then?  
//
//	(320 - 319, 240 - 239)			=         (1, 1)
// 
//  Now we have a vector of (1, 1).  In our case, those numbers are too high
//  when we are dealing with radians, not degrees.  To remedy this, we need to
//  make the number a bit smaller, I just divide by a number like 1000.  Now
//  we have a vector of (0.001, 0.001).  We want to pass the X value in as our
//  Y-axis rotation, BUT we need to negate it.  Because if we rotate by a positive number
//  it will move the camera to the RIGHT, and we want to go to the left.  This will take care
//  of when we move the mouse right too.  If the vector is negative, it will make it positive.
//
//  You'll notice we added some math functions at the top of this file.  These help us
//  determine the axis that we need to rotate around for up and down.  By grabbing
//  a 90 degree penpendicular vector to the side of the camera, we can then use
//  that as our axis to rotate around.  This took a bit to figure out at first.
//  It wasn't as simple as just rotating around the x-axis, because we are walking
//  around the x and z axis all the time, so the rotations need to change axises.
//
//  Notice that with the new CVector3 additions, we can't say:
//
//  CVector3 vVector = {0, 0, 0};
//  
//  It must be:
//
//  CVector3 vVector = CVector(0, 0, 0);
//
//  This is because we have a default constructor, so there is no more {}'s.
//  We can now create a CVector3 on the fly, without having to directory assing
//  a variable name to it.  The default copy constructor does all the work.
