//******************************************************************


Files:  	Main.cpp (The Source File containing the main program code)
		Tile.cpp (The Source File containing the tile and map code)
		Tile.h (The Header File containing the tile and map definitions)
		Main.h (The Header File containing the main program definitions)

		AsciiMapEditor.vcproj  (The VC++ Project File holding the project info)
		AsciiMapEditor.sln  (The Solution File holding the solution info)
		*.txt (These files store the data for the monster, item and npc tiles)
		Default.map (The example saved map file to test the loading)

Instructions:	If you have Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (version 7.0) just click on the
		<Program Name>.vcproj file.  This will open up visual c++.  You will most
		likely see the code for <Program Name>.cpp.  If you don't, press CRTL+ALT+L
		This will open the "Solution Explorer".  There you should find two folders named
		"Source Files" and "Header Files".  Double click on the "source" folder and you
		should see your source file(s) with a .cpp extension after it.  Double click on the
		file and it will open up in your main window.  Hit Control-F5 to run the program.
		You will probably see a prompt to compile/build the project.  Click OK and
		the Win32 console program should pop up. :)

		This version doesn't allow much functionality, but allows you to select
		different tiles from the editor and change their colors.  The next tutorial
		will show you how to insert those tiles on the map, along with other tiles.
